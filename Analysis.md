# CitiBike Analysis

After reviewing NYC CitiBike data from May - July 2019, below are some interesting insights found.

    * The top 10 stations where trips start and end are the same but in slightly different order.  However even those similarities exist, when you compare the them by trip duration they have 7 out of 10 matching.
  
    *  When you begin to look at the user breakdown, the majority of riders are subsribers that are male ages between 36 - 50. When you look at the average trip in minutes, generally customers trip duration is longer than subscribers.  The potential cause could be that customers are tourists riding longer distance to see the city vs subscribers that live in the city ride shorterd distances to work, store, and et al. 
  
    *  The other intersting information found was that when reviewing looking at the most frequent start times during the week. The data shows M-F busiest times are 7-9am and 4-7pm, while on Saturday and Sunday the busiest times are 12-6pm.  This could back up the fact above that subscribers utilize the bikes for travel to and from work based on the M-F times.
